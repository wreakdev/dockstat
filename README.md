A minimalist, fast, and clean command-line tool for monitoring your running Docker containers. Forget about the clutter of standard `docker ps` outputs—`dockstat` delivers all the essential information you need at a single glance.

## Features
- **Container Overview**: ID, name, and image name in clean, readable format.
- **Status Monitoring**: See instantly if your container is running, paused, or stopped.
- **RAM Usage**: Real-time memory consumption in MB.
- **Uptime**: Know exactly how long your container has been alive.
- **Port Mapping**: Quick overview of active container ports

## Requirements
- Go 1.26 or higher (if you build it yourself)
- `github.com/fatih/color`
- `github.com/docker`
## Setup
### Quick Install (Recommended)
**Linux / MacOS**:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wreakdev/dockstat/main/dockstat_setup.sh | bash
```
### Manual Install (From Source)
if you prefer to clone and build yourself:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wreakdev/dockstat
cd dockstat
chnod +x dockstat_setup.sh

## Troubleshooting (PATH issues)
if the command is not found, add this to your `.bashrc` (or `.zshrc`):

```
### Then save and run: `source .bashrc` (or `source .zshrc`)
